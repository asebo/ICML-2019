## Summary

In this folder we include plots demonstrating the performance of ASEBO vs. other blackbox algorithms for Nevergrad functions with a 1000 dimensions. We also include VkD-CMA-ES after recommendation from reviewers. 

We include two versions, base and manifold, as described in the paper. We use a manifold size of 20% (rather than 5%) based on the recommendation of reviewers.
